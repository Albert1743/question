        <button class="question">What is eSIM?</button>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>An eSIM is a digital SIM that eliminates the need for a physical SIM card. With eSIM, you can quickly and
                easily transfer an existing cellular plan or get a new cellular plan, all digitally. You can even store
                multiple eSIMs on the same device and use two phone numbers at the same time. And it’s more secure -
                someone
                can’t remove the physical SIM card if your iPhone is lost or stolen. In just a few simple steps, you are
                ready to make calls, send messages, and browse the web. <a href="#"> Learn more</a> about eSIM.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>* Use of eSIM requires a wireless service plan. Not all carriers support eSIM. Use of eSIM in iPhone may
                be
                disabled when purchased from some carriers. Check with your carrier for details and restrictions. <a

        <button class="question">Can I activate an iPhone 15 or iPhone 15 Pro outside of the United States?</button>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>iPhone 15 or iPhone 15 Pro models purchased in the U.S. or Puerto Rico don’t have a physical SIM tray and
                activate only using eSIM. You can activate your iPhone outside the country if your carrier supports
                eSIM. <a href="#">Learn more</a> about using eSIM while traveling.</p>

        <button class="question">When I buy from apple.com, does my iPhone come ready to use?</button>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>Carrier-connected iPhone SE, iPhone 13, iPhone 14, iPhone 15, and iPhone 15 Pro models will arrive ready
                to

            </p>
            <br>
            <p>If you completed the steps to authorize activation with AT&T, T-Mobile, or Verizon when you purchased
                your
                new iPhone online, it will arrive ready to use. Just turn it on and follow the onscreen instructions to
                set
                it up and activate with the carrier. To activate with eSIM, you will need Wi-Fi for setup.</p>
            <br>
            <p>If you choose "Connect to a carrier later" when you buy your iPhone, you can activate with your service
                when
                you receive your device. If you're asked to transfer your SIM, follow the onscreen instructions to
                transfer
                service from your previous iPhone. To learn more, visit https://support.apple.com/kb/HT212780</p>

        <button class="question">Will my new iPhone be unlocked?</button>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>Yes. An iPhone purchased from apple.com is unlocked. Once your new iPhone is activated, it remains
                unlocked,
                which means you can use it with any network that provides service for iPhone. The exception is when you
                buy
                an iPhone with an AT&T Installment Plan. It will be locked to AT&T and will only work on the AT&T
                network
                for the term of your Installment Plan agreement.</p>

        <button class="question">How does the iPhone Upgrade Program work?</button>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>The iPhone Upgrade Program is the easiest way to upgrade to the latest iPhone, and it also offers the
                security and protection of AppleCare+.</p>
            <br>
            <p>If you are new to the iPhone Upgrade Program, you can learn more about joining here(Opens in a new
                window).
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>If you are already part of the program, start by checking your upgrade status to see if you’re eligible
                for a
                new iPhone. If you are, you can either proceed with your upgrade online or visit an Apple Store and chat
                with a Specialist. You can upgrade anytime after six months, as long as you’ve made the equivalent of at
                least 12 payments. If you have to pay an additional amount to meet your 12 payments, you can do it when
                you
                upgrade. We will arrange for you to trade in your old iPhone as part of the program, so please do not
                trade
                in your current iPhone using the standard Apple Trade In option.</p>
